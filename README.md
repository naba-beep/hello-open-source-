# **Hello, I'm Nayab**

I'm a digital artist from Pakistan stepping into the world of open source.  
I don't come from a coding background, but I'm learning Git, Markdown, and how to contribute through documentation, storytelling, and design.

## **What I'm Learning**
* How to use GitHub and Git
* Open source contribution workflows
* Markdown & technical documentation

## **What I Love**
* Digital art & visual storytelling
* Digital painting and web design on figma
* Creating resources that make tech more human and accessible

## **Goals**
* Make my first real open source contribution
* Join Outreachy and contribute meaningfully to a community project
* Grow into a creative tech contributor who helps others feel seen in the space
